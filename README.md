# Computer Vision Practice
Hello and welcome to the Computer Vision Guide by Alan Onofre. My goal is to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts and techniques in Computer Vision. Whether you're interested in applying Computer Vision to fields like Deep Learning, Robotics, or App Development, this guide will support you with the necessary knowledge and skills to explore and succeed in these areas. Let's dive into the exciting world of Computer Vision!

# Libraries to install in order to perform CV files
In order to use OpenCV and get precise results install the following libraries:
Numpy: `pip install numpy`
Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib` 

# Course Guide
Each carpet provides his own scripts that are related to diverse subjects of computer vision such as descriptors images, object detectors or image segmentation. Also, there you
can find the images that are used to load this examples.

# Advance Scripts Folder
Here you will find scripts which requires more structural programming skills or knowledge in some areas such as neural networks

# Extras Folder
Here you can find some additional operations that help in the development of some scripts of the guide as resize images or generate data for a model of object detection
